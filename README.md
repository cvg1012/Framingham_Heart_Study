# Framingham Heart Study
The Framingham Heart Study is a long term prospective study of cardiovascular disease among a population of subjects. It was the first prospective study of cardiovascular disease and identified the concept of risk factors in patients using various factors.

Created a Linear Probability Model and Logistic Regression model to predict the number of records showing positive heart disease cases using statistically significant variables such as age, cigarettes per day, total cholesterol and glucose level. Performed Data exploration and data pre-processing tasks using R.
